# The SystemC / Catapult-HLS backend

`target="systemc"` turns an Allo `@df.region` dataflow design into synthesizable **SystemC**
that Siemens **Catapult HLS** compiles to RTL. This document explains how that backend works.
It is written for someone new to the Allo compiler (and to HLS emitters in general), so it
starts with background and builds up to the mechanisms and the files involved.

with line references, see the companion `mlir/lib/Translation/EmitSystemC.md`.*

---

## Background you need first

**Allo** lets you write hardware as a Python **dataflow region** — a `@df.region` whose body
constructs `Stream`/`Channel`/`Wire` links and calls `@df.kernel`s that talk over them. The
Allo frontend lowers that to **MLIR** (the compiler IR): each kernel becomes a `func.func`
tagged `df.kernel`, the region top a `func.func` tagged `top`, and the links become Allo
dialect ops (`allo.stream_construct`, `allo.channel_get`, …).

**An HLS emitter** is the compiler stage that walks that MLIR and *prints C++* — no RTL yet.
The C++ is then handed to a High-Level-Synthesis tool (Vitis, or here **Catapult**) which
schedules it into Verilog. Allo has three emitters, and they form a **subclass chain**:

```
VhlsModuleEmitter  (Vivado/Vitis: ap_int, #pragma HLS ...)          EmitVivadoHLS.cpp  (~3400 lines)
   └── CatapultModuleEmitter  (swaps to ac_int, #pragma hls_...)    EmitCatapultHLS.cpp (~640 lines, thin)
          └── SystemCModuleEmitter  (SC_MODULE + Connections links) EmitSystemC.cpp     (~3000 lines)
```

Each layer **overrides only what differs** and inherits the rest. Catapult is a thin subclass
of Vivado that swaps the vendor types (`ap_int` → `ac_int`) and pragmas (`#pragma HLS pipeline`
→ `#pragma hls_pipeline_init_interval`). SystemC subclasses Catapult and replaces the
*structure* (functions → `SC_MODULE`s) and the *links* (arrays/`hls::stream` → MatchLib
Connections), while still reusing the base for arithmetic, control flow, and most of the body.

**The three build modes** — the same emitted C++, exercised three ways:

| mode | what runs | `__SYNTHESIS__` | what it proves |
|---|---|---|---|
| `csim` | g++ compiles + runs the SystemC on the host | not defined | functional correctness (fast) |
| `csyn` | Catapult synthesizes the SystemC → Verilog | defined | it synthesizes; area / Fmax |
| `cosim` | the synthesized RTL runs in Xcelium vs the csim "golden" | defined | RTL is bit-exact with csim |

**Key fact to keep in mind:** csim and synthesis compile *different code*. The emitter is full
of `#ifdef __SYNTHESIS__` splits (the loop shape, the `ap_int` shim, `wait()` placement). So a
green csim does **not** prove the RTL is right — run `cosim`.

---

## The design decisions

**Decision 1 — subclass, don't rewrite.** `SystemCModuleEmitter` inherits from
`CatapultModuleEmitter` so it gets `ac_int`/`ac_fixed` codegen and Catapult loop pragmas for
free, and only overrides the ~26 handlers that must produce SystemC. (If it inherited from
Vivado directly it would emit Xilinx `#pragma HLS ...`, which Catapult ignores.) Every method
definition in `EmitSystemC.cpp` is tagged `// override (base emitter)` or `// new (SystemC-only)`
so you can tell reused-and-tweaked behavior from SystemC-specific behavior at a glance.

**Decision 2 — three link primitives, three hardware realizations.** Allo's links are not a
cosmetic label; each maps to genuinely different RTL:

| Allo link | RTL | handshake | buffered | use when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Wire` | `sc_signal<T>` | none (combinational) | no | producer/consumer are cycle-locked |
| `Channel` (valid_ready) | `Connections::Combinational<T>` | full valid/ready | no | flow-controlled point link |
| `Channel` (valid_only) | raw `_dat` + `_vld` signals | valid only (no ready) | no | cheap one-way link; a race may drop a datum |
| `Stream[T, depth]` | `Connections::Fifo` (`AlloFifoC`) | credit/handshake | yes | real elastic buffering between kernels |

`Known limitation:` a `Wire` gives **zero storage and zero alignment** — it silently reads
garbage unless the two kernels are cycle-locked; `valid_only` **drops** a datum if the consumer
is not looking that cycle. Both are deliberate performance points, not bugs — pick them only
when you own the timing.

**Decision 3 — `ac_int` everywhere, with an `ap_int` shim for the leftovers.** The reused Vivado
body still prints Vitis `ap_int` types and `x(hi,lo)` bit-slice syntax. Rather than override
every such site, the emitted header aliases `ap_int` to a thin **`ac_int` subclass** that adds
the two Vitis affordances (`(hi,lo)` and `>64-bit` narrowing). Under `__SYNTHESIS__` it collapses
to a plain `ac_int` alias. `Known limitation:` a design that bit-slices a *packed >64-bit* value
works in csim but can fail at `csyn` (Catapult rejects subclassing its builtin `ac_int`, CIN-15).

**Decision 4 — a kernel's steady-state loop becomes `while(1)` for synthesis.** A dataflow
kernel's outermost `for t in range(NUM_IT)` runs one router/PE *step* per iteration. Emitted as a
finite loop before the terminal idle loop, Catapult classifies the whole body as **reset action**
and never pipelines it (measured: 5–17 cycles/step). Emitting it **as `while(1)`** under
`__SYNTHESIS__` gives Catapult the pipelinable shape (a step every clock). This only fires when
the loop counter is *dead* (unused) and the kernel doesn't store to a memory port — so genuinely
counted loops stay bounded. See "How it works" for the guard.

**Decision 5 — random-access arrays become memory ports.** A 1-D array scanned strictly in order
(`a[i]` in one loop) is realized as a cheap **stream** (`a[i]` → `.Pop()`). Anything else (2-D,
strided, random, re-read) can't be a FIFO, so it becomes a **memory port**: an addressable
`AlloMem`/`AlloMemW` behind a req/rsp channel, indexed by a flattened row-major address.

---

## How it works, stage by stage

```
@df.region  ──flatten──►  per-kernel SC_MODULEs  ──►  top wiring SC_MODULE  ──►  device header + tb
 (MLIR)      (inline        (one SC_THREAD each,        (instantiate kernels,      (type shims,
              sub-regions)   ports = links)              connect channels)          AlloMem/AlloFifoC)
```

**Stage 0 — flatten the hierarchy** (`flattenHierarchy`). A SystemC `SC_THREAD` can't
structurally instantiate a sub-region, so before emitting, every call to a *non-leaf* callee
(a sub-region, or a kernel that calls one) is **inlined** into the top, transitively, until the
top is a flat set of channel constructs + leaf-kernel calls. A design that's already flat is a
no-op.

**Stage 1 — each kernel → an `SC_MODULE`** (`emitKernelModule`). For a `@df.kernel`:
- Every argument becomes a **port**, classified from two frontend string attributes: `stypes`
  (stream/channel/wire dir) and `arg_dirs` (memref dir `i`/`o`/`b`). A directional 1-D
  sequentially-scanned array → a `Connections::In/Out` stream port; a random-access array → a
  memory port (`_req`/`_rsp`); a `Wire` → a raw `sc_in/sc_out`.
- A clocked `SC_THREAD run()` is registered with reset (`async_reset_signal_is` by default;
  set env `ALLO_SYNC_RESET` for synchronous reset — smaller flops on the ASIC path).
- `run()` resets its ports, then emits the kernel body. `get`/`put` on the body's links become
  `.Pop()`/`.Push()` (stream), `.PopNB()`/`.PushNB()` (`try_*`), or `sc_signal.read()/write()`
  (wire); `a[i]`/`b[i]=v` on a stream-ified array become `.Pop()`/`.Push()`.

  ```cpp
  // before (MLIR):  affine.load %a[%i] ; arith.addi ; affine.store %b[%i]
  // after (SystemC):
      ac_int<32,true> v = a.Pop();   // a[i]  -> Pop
      ac_int<32,true> r = v + 1;
      b.Push(r);                     // b[i]= -> Push
  ```

**Stage 2 — the region top → a wiring `SC_MODULE`** (`emitTopModule`). It declares a channel
member per link (`Connections::Combinational`, an `AlloFifoC` for buffered streams, an `sc_signal`
for wires), instantiates each kernel, and binds every kernel port to the right channel. Boundary
arrays become either top-level stream ports or internal `AlloMem`/`AlloMemW` memories (decided by
`regArgMemPort`). Each kernel's `done` is AND-ed into a top-level `done`.

**Stage 3 — the device header + testbench** (`emitModule`). Emits the C++ preamble: MatchLib
Connections includes, the float shims, the `ap_int` shim, and the component library — `AlloMem`
(read/write memory), `AlloMemW` (write-only), `AlloFifoC` (the FWFT buffered FIFO). Then a
testbench that drives the boundary streams from `input<N>.data`, runs the design, and checks
`output<N>.data`.

---

## What the finished pipeline produces

For the `add1` kernel above (`a: int32[8]` in, `b: int32[8]` out), the emitter produces:

```cpp
SC_MODULE(add1) {
  sc_in_clk clk;  sc_in<bool> rst;  sc_out<bool> done;
  Connections::In < ac_int<32, true> > a;     // 1-D, scanned in order -> stream In
  Connections::Out< ac_int<32, true> > b;     //                       -> stream Out
  SC_HAS_PROCESS(add1);
  add1(sc_module_name n) : sc_module(n), done("done"), a("a"), b("b") {
    SC_THREAD(run); sensitive << clk.pos(); async_reset_signal_is(rst, false);
  }
  void run() {
    a.Reset(); b.Reset(); done.write(false); wait();
#ifdef __SYNTHESIS__
    while (1) {                                 // steady-state loop (was `for i`)
#else
    l_steady: for (int i = 0; i < 8; i += 1) {
#endif
      ac_int<32,true> v = a.Pop();
      b.Push(v + 1);
#ifndef __SYNTHESIS__
      wait();                                   // csim: SC_THREAD must yield each step
#endif
    }
    done.write(true);
    while (1) { wait(); }
  }
};
```

The direct MLIR → SystemC mappings:

| MLIR | SystemC |
|---|---|
| `func.func @add1` (`df.kernel`) | `SC_MODULE(add1)` + `SC_THREAD(run)` |
| seq-streamable memref arg, dir `i`/`o` | `Connections::In/Out<ac_int<W,S>>` |
| `affine.load %a[%i]` / `affine.store %b[%i]` | `a.Pop()` / `b.Push(v)` |
| random-access memref arg | `AlloMem` req/rsp memory port |
| outermost `affine.for`, dead counter | `while(1)` (synth) / `for` (csim) |
| `allo.channel_get/put`, `allo.stream_*` | `.Pop()/.Push()`, `.PopNB()/.PushNB()`, `empty()/full()` sidebands |

## How to use it

```python
import allo.dataflow as df

# functional simulation (host g++):
mod = df.build(design, target="systemc", mode="csim",  project="out/csim")
mod(inputs...)

# RTL cosim (Catapult synth + Xcelium, checked bit-exact vs the csim golden):
mod = df.build(design, target="systemc", mode="cosim", project="out/cosim")
mod(inputs...)                                   # prints "cosim MATCH" on success
```

For synthesis area/Fmax, synthesize a single kernel as the top (excludes the testbench harness):

```bash
ALLO_DESIGN_TOP=<kernel>_0  python your_csyn_driver.py     # -> rtl.v + cycle.rpt
```

Environment knobs: `ALLO_SYNC_RESET` (synchronous reset), and — for the steady-state loop
transform — the kernel's outermost `for t` must have a **dead counter** and no memory-port store.

`Known limitation:` run `cosim`, not just `csim`, before trusting synthesis — the two paths
differ (loop shape, `ap_int` shim). See `mlir/lib/Translation/EmitSystemC.md` for the full list
of `#ifdef __SYNTHESIS__` divergences.

## Verification performed

The backend was validated by re-implementing the open-source **RaveNoC** hand-written RTL router
as an Allo design (`rvn_router.py`) and checking equivalence on RaveNoC's *own* captured traffic
(vanilla config: 2 VC, buffer 2, 2×2 mesh, XY routing):

- **Functional (csim):** routing (all 4 routers), a 256-flit wormhole packet, and VC-priority
  QoS under concurrent contention — all deliver losslessly to the RaveNoC-correct ports.
- **RTL (cosim):** the Catapult-synthesized Allo RTL is **bit-exact** with the csim golden on
  both synthetic contention vectors and the real 256-flit packet.
- **Physical (Genus 23.1, Nangate 45nm, matched config):** Allo 448 MHz / 11.2k µm² vs RaveNoC
  hand-RTL 547 MHz / 7.7k µm² — the HLS router is functionally equivalent, ~1.22× slower and
  ~1.46× larger, with the gap attributable to the single-`SC_THREAD` arbitration recurrence.

A `csim`-vs-`cosim` regression harness design (to catch `#ifdef`-divergence regressions) is
sketched in `tests/dataflow/COSIM_REGRESSION.md`.

## Files

The SystemC backend's dependency closure (all required for `target="systemc"` to build and run):

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `mlir/lib/Translation/EmitSystemC.cpp` | the emitter (this document's subject); companion `EmitSystemC.md` has line-referenced internals |
| `mlir/include/allo/Translation/EmitSystemC.h` | its public declaration (`emitSystemC`) |
| `mlir/include/allo/Dialect/LIMOps.td` | Wire/Channel/Stream ops (get/put/try/empty/full/construct) |
| `mlir/include/allo/Dialect/AlloTypes.td` | `WireType` / `ChannelType` / `StreamType` |
| `mlir/include/allo/Dialect/AlloAttrs.td` | `ChannelProtocol` (valid_ready / valid_only) |
| `mlir/lib/Dialect/AlloOps.cpp` | op verifiers/builders for the above |

| `allo/backend/catapult.py` | the `platform=="systemc"` build / csim / csyn / cosim flow |

Plus the dataflow frontend that provides the `Wire`/`Channel`/`Stream` Python types and the
`emit_systemc` Python binding. Most of this is already on the `wire` branch; the emitter's own
comment cleanup + the override/new tags + the `TODO: REVISIT` flags are the changes that
accompany this document.
